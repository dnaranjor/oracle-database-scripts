Oracle Database Server scripts that let us all rest at night
============================================================

This is just an open, Internet-centric repository of all the SQL scripts I've been both developing and finding through the years as an Oracle's DBA.

Parallel projects will be SQL Server and Sybase ASE scripts.

Collaborations allowed, of course.
